## Breif Review 
Urdu is a less developed language as compared to English. That's why it lacks resources of research and development for natural language processing, speech recognition, and other AI and ML related problems. It took so long to build a dataset and enhance it for NLP tasks because the datasets which are available are not enough to do ML. Most of the dataset is proprietary which restricts the researchers and developers.

This is contain all the necessory steps performed for the NER for the Urdu.
